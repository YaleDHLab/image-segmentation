quite surprised however to see no mention of the concert in one of the dailies the wed nesday morning following the concert and in the other only a few lines and that not very complimentary if the concert had been poor there might have been some excuse for the derogatory re marks but all who attended the concert were unanimous in their praise and the boston papers spoke very highly of it judging by the applause the audience were not only pleased but delighted notwithstanding har yard critics to the contrary it seems to us very poor taste for the harvard pa ers to make unfavorable comparisons be tween their glee club and ours if they think they could have sung better it would have been much more cour teous to have kept their opinion to themselves tdrof phelps although he has only -*- been with us a short time is already one of our most popular instructors he has shown by the clearness of his remarks and the earnestness with which he delivers his lectures that he is not only a master of the subject upon which he is speaking but also that he possesses the power of catching and holding the attention of his hearers it was not our object in writing this to speak of the ability or success of professor phelps as a lecturer or instructor but to call the atten tion of the few and we are glad to say they are very few men who do not pay due regard to the proprieties while in the recitation room used by our genial professor of law whisper ing and mild skylarking are bad enough even when carried on in the room of the most hated teacher but when men indulge in childish actions while under the eyes of an instructor whose feelings and sentiments are so kindly shown to be with us we can see but little excuse for them we are glad to say that the number of men who have in any way misbehaved is very small and we trust that they will see how foolish their actions are and that professor phelps will not on his return be subjected to annoyance of any kind amusements
