<transc>yale daily news new haven conn friday january 24 1896 vol xiv.jgno 87 price three cents the open game the captain of yale's first eleven writes favoring more open play to the editor of the yale news : for several years there has been a growing desire for more open play in the game of football this has found expression in many ways the latest of which is the suggestion to take up the english rugby game as a kind of side recreation and exer cise for those not on the regular teams our present game has been developed all to the massing of the men upon the center at the sacrifice of nearly all of the open play which was once its most important and attractive feature and by giving an exaggerated importance to the scrimmage and the play evolved therefrom has greatly in creased the personal contact of the individual members of the opposing sides this has subjected the game to much criticism some of which is very just on account of the heavy work and many injuries resulting and has made weight and excep tional strength such necessary qual ifications in the players that the great majority have been disquali fied from taking part but to change to a radically different game would be at the loss of all the work and experience of years and even for those not on the university team to take up entirely new rules and methods of play would but lead to confusion and misunderstanding among players who must from time to time fill up the vacancies occur ring on the team furthermore the english rugby game is weakest in that very particular which is most open to criticism in our own in stead of a scrimmage regulated by most stringent rules the english scrimmage is but an indiscriminate struggle far more productive of in jury and very nearly devoid of any science or skill there is another suggestion which has occurred to many of those who were once players and who have watched the game with deep interest from the time it was first taken up at yale and that is for the general players to open up the present game after the methods which prevailed at first this would not necessitate the learning of a new set of rules but only a few modifications of those now in use and with the recogni tion of a few important principles would enable any one at all profi cient in the one to take part in the other and consequently would not impair the eligibility of a player when called upon to fill a vacancy upon the university team the principal difference between the earlier game and the present is in the methods of playing the scrimmage and the rules for off-side formerly no off-side play whatever was al lowed consequently no interference ahead of the ball only side interfer ence was possible but the player having the ball protected himself from being tackled in front by pass ing the ball to those supporting him on either side and they in turn to others so long as progress could be made and then it went to the half back or backs for the kick or punt the principle ever in the mind of the player being not to be caught with the ball in his possession and not to hold it for a down and thus bring on the scrimmage except in an extreme emergency in the scrimmage when the ball was snapped back the player receiv ing it instead of attempting to make any advance by means of the scrim mage or other mass plays passed it to one side or the other according to previous direction as far out to the open as possible to those of his side awaiting it or he passed it to the rear for a kick or punt thus scattering the scrimmage at once and carrying out the general princi ple of open play the open play demands great agility and fast running accurate passing and catching and good kick ing and punting and at all times the greatest skill and strategy the victory is won by the players ability to out-maneuvre his opponents and his quickness in execution rather than by combined pushing and massive assaults and like all other forms of athlet ics it requires good and careful training to enable the player to ac complish the best results both for himself personally and for those he represents in fact training for football was first introduced in the open game but one of its most ' important advantages is its compar ative freedom from injury to the players this has sometimes been questioned the history of the past however will demonstrate conclu sively that it was the exception rather than the rule for a substitute to be called into a game and there were years when the same members of a team played every game of the season without an injury—an exper ience not very common of late years it is adapted to a much larger number of persons who while not possessing exceptional weight and strength have nevertheless the true football spirit with good endurance and mental and physical activity this fact would make the open style of play very popular and in a little time would have an advantageous influence upon the present intercol legiate game it is the desire of all lovers of the game of football to see it develop and improve in the fu ture as it has in the past and this will be best accomplished by modi fying the present game in those particulars only which experience has clearly shown the necessity but to divide the attention by taking up several totally different kinds of games will but weaken the best efforts of all and result finally in an unstable style of play varying from year to year according to the preju dices or influences of those in con trol and we shall retrograde to the condition which existed before 1876 when each year saw the game change to the associate american or rugby rules with such frequency as to preclude any true progress e v baker 77 academic military company captain
