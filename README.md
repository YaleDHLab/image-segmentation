## Image Segmentation

#### Images
`images` contains plots generated by the segmentation script. These images help show the various stages of the data during the course of analysis.

#### Periodical Images
`periodical_images` contains the input images to be segmented by the routine. These images consist of periodical clippings on a white background. 

#### Segmented Articles
`segmented_articles` contains the output from the workflow, which consists of a series of images, with each image representing a single article clipping.

#### segment_periodicals.py
`segment_periodicals.py` contains the code used to segment input images into disparate output images. Usage: `python segment_periodicals.py {{path to jp2 file in periodical_images}}`
